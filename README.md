BLOC offers a JavaScript miner for the [BLOC](https://bloc.money/) cryptocurrency that you can embed in your website. Your users run the miner directly in their Browser and mine BLOC for you in turn for an ad-free experience, in-game currency or whatever incentives you can come up with.

We are excited to see how you will use this service. We dream about it as an alternative to micro payments, artificial wait time in online games, intrusive ads and dubious marketing tactics.

Your users can “pay” you with full privacy, without registering an account anywhere, without installing a browser extension and without being bombarded by shady ads. They will pay you with just their CPU power.

### Files available in this script

- **m.js** - the actual miner that handles [javascript workers](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webworkers.asp) and [websockets connections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- **worker.js** - the worker receives a job and calculates the hash
- **cn.js** - the actual [webasm](https://webassembly.org/) mining algorithm
- **test_with_output.html** - [HTML](https://www.scaler.com/topics/html/) file that outputs some mining stats (this will start the whole mining process)
- **test_minimal.html** - html file with minimal setup (no mining output stats)

### How to set it up

Copy all the files on a domain and change the following:

```javascript
var mining_pool = 'bloc-mining.eu'; // mining pool domain
```

this is the mining pool domain. we recommend leaving it untouched.

```javascript
var mining_port = '4444'; // mining pool port
```

this is the mining pool port (for CPU mining). we recommend leaving it untouched.

```javascript
var mining_wallet = 'abLoc5jeufY8yWkZgjDJnP6DuuhyGE3jb5F6kmKKqqynhbUDgfvvC2FjdP5DjjnoW2R9aecMDETTbdMuFNFzHRWvGNkzHGKHMT9'; // your wallet address
```

this is the wallet where the coins will be sent by the mining pool.

Edit m.js file and go to the line where you find  

```javascript
var newWorker = new Worker("https://bloc-mining.com/assets/frontpanel/js/newminer/worker.js?_=" + Math.random().toString());
```

the `https://bloc-mining.com/assets/frontpanel/js/newminer/worker.js` is the path to `worker.js` file from the `js` folder. Make sure you use the absolute path, like it is here.  
The reason it's hardcoded, is to be harder for antiviruses to find it.  

### How to run it

Simply navigate to `test_minimal.html` and you will start mining.

### Notes

- To mine, choose one of the .html files `test_with_output.html` or `test_minimal.html`. Do not use them both!
- All .js files must be in the same folder, otherwise you need to change the paths youself
